            <p>Well, look what the cat dragged in!</p>
            <p>Andrew William deHaas: first of his name, ruler of his domain, Lord of the Platypus: God's Retard, and general criminal.</p>
            <p>Andrew is an amalgamation of society. He is part nerd, part athlete, but, most importantly, an all-around person. That's right. He's a person. I know, I know, that sounds crazy, but it is what it is.</p>
            <p>WHERE IS GAMORA?! I'll do me one better: WHO is Gamora?! I'll do myself one better again: WHY is Gamora!?</p>
            <p>If you're still on the fence about this, Thanos absolutely did something wrong.</p>
